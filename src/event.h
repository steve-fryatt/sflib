/**
 * \file event.h
 *
 * SFLib - Simple event-based Wimp_Poll dispatch system.
 *
 * EventLib provides a simple message dispatch system for Wimp_Poll events.
 * Support for Redraw_Window, Open_Window, Close_Window, Pointer_Leaving_Window,
 * Pointer_Entering_Window, Mouse_Click, Key_Pressed, Scroll_Request,
 * Lose_Caret and Gain_Caret are provided on a window-by-window basis, with
 * details being passed to the appropriate event handler if one has been
 * registered. In addition, menus are handled with additional code to provide a
 * window-by-window implementation. Support for attaching additional events
 * to specific icons within dialogue boxes is provided.
 *
 * Support for User Messages is provided on a message-by-message basis, while
 * dragging is supported on a one-off basis for the current claimant of the
 * drag box. Null polls are not supported outside of dragging.
 *
 * All unclaimed and unrouted events are passed back to the caller, to be
 * handled via other methods.
 *
 * ==Standard Event Support
 *
 * Standard events (those listed above) are handed on a window-by-window basis,
 * with details being sent to the hander registered for the window referenced
 * in the block supplied via Wimp_Poll.  If no suitable handler is registered,
 * then event_process_event() returns FALSE to show that the event has not been
 * handled by EventLib.
 *
 * Standard event handlers can not return their status to EventLib, so the
 * fact that a handler has been called is considered to mean that it has been
 * handled.
 *
 * ==Icon Click Handlers
 *
 * It is possible to register specific handlers to process clicks on icons
 * within a window. These cause specific actions to be carried out, either in
 * place of or in addition to the generic Mouse Click handler.  Each of the
 * handlers associated with an icon will be called in turn, regardless of
 * whether any 'claim' the event.
 *
 * If any of the individual icon handlers are deemed to have 'claimed' the
 * event, then the Mouse Click hander associated with the parent window will not
 * then be called.
 *
 * ==Menus
 *
 * EventLib provides support for menu handling which simplifies the
 * implementation of Style Guide compliant interfaces. Two types of menu are
 * supported: 'window' menus registered via event_add_window_menu(), and
 * 'pop-up' menus registred via event_add_window_icon_popup().
 *
 * Window menus are conventional menus which open at the pointer when the
 * Menu button is pressed. If the window is the iconbar, then the menu is
 * treated as an iconbar menu and opened in an appropriate location relative
 * to the base of the screen. Pop-Up menus are associated with an icon in a
 * window, and open aligned to its right-hand side: usually they will be used
 * in conjunction with a "gright" icon and a text field.
 *
 * Four 'events' are created by EventLib to streamline menu handling, which
 * can be registered for a window in the same way as the 'real' events returned
 * from Wimp_Poll. These events hide all Menu_Selection events from the client,
 * but also hide some Mouse_Click and User_Message events when these relate to
 * a menu being handled by EventLib.  If an event handler is registerd for a
 * window, it is called for all associated window and pop-up menus.
 *
 * Menu Prepare events occur when one of EventLib's menus is about to be opened
 * on a mouse click or re-opened in response to an Adjust-click selection, and
 * should be used to prepare the menu (ticking or shading entries).  The event
 * can also be used to substitute a new menu handle, allowing menus to be
 * created dynamically.
 *
 * Once a menu is open, Menu Warning events are sent whenever a submenu warning
 * message is received.  A Menu Selection event is sent when a selection is
 * made (with Select or Adjust).  A Menu Close event is sent when the menu
 * closes, either via a Select-click selection, or via a click away from the
 * menu itself.
 *
 * It follows from the above that any Mouse Click event handler associated
 * with a window will never be called to process Menu-clicks if the window has
 * a Window menu associated with it.
 *
 *
 * ==User Messages
 *
 * User Message handlers can be added via event_add_message_handler(), which
 * takes a message number, the 'type' of message ('standard', recorded,
 * acknowledge or some combination as specified by enum event_message_type),
 * and a function to be called to handle receipt of matching events from
 * the system.
 *
 * The callback function takes a standard wimp_message block pointer to hold
 * details of the receved message.  It returns with TRUE if the message should
 * be 'claimed' (and hence not passed on to any further registered handlers),
 * or FALSE if the message should not be 'claimed' (and hence offered to the
 * next handler registered with EventLib).  In general, handlers for
 * informational 'broadcast' messages should always return FALSE to ensure that
 * all interested parties see the message.
